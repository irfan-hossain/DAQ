# DAQ: Data Acquisition System

This project uses a Raspberry Pi and Arduino Uno to create a high speed data acquisition system. The project is based on the OpenLabTools guide provided by the Univeristy of Cambridge, provided [here](http://openlabtools.eng.cam.ac.uk/Resources/Datalog/RPi_Arduino/). There are a few modifications from the original guide and implementation differences.   

# Hardware
   * Raspberry Pi 2
   * Arduino Uno
   * OLED Display
   * Light Sensor    
   * Adafruit T-Cobbler Plus
   * Serial Cable
